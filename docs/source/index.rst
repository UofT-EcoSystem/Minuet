MinuetðŸŽ¶ is :strike:`a social dance for two people, usually in 3/4 time` a library that efficiently implements sparse convolutions (SC) for point clouds on GPUs.
Minuet use **sorted tables** and **binary search** for building kernel maps, which results in on average
:math:`15.8\times` (up to :math:`26.8\times`) speedup compared to hash table implementations in existing libraries.

Code Structure and Call Stack
=============================

Minuet is implemented as a torch extension. Every functionality of Minuet is
implemented with a Python interface with compiled C++ extension binary which
consists of three layers of function calls:

* PyTorch Wrappers: This layer interacts with the calls from Python and is
  responsible for calling the corresponding C++ wrappers.
* C++ Function Wrappers: We use a C++ function wrapper to avoid including the
  PyTorch's header to reduce the compile time during development. This layer is
  also responsible for launching CUDA kernels.
* CUDA Kernels: This layer implements the core functionality of Minuet on GPUs.

The following figure demonstrates the call stack of the kernel map building
process.
